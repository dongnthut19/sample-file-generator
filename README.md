# sample-file-generator

Simple NodeJS app to auto-generate potentially thousands of sample documents.

This was put together to stress testing integrations with cloud storage systems like (Dropbox, etc).

# Running

Change configuration settings in `app\config.json`

Then `npm run start`

# Development

All code was written in Typescript, although the code in `\generator` was ported from existing javascript samples
